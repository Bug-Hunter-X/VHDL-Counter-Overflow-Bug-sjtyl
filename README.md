This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in VHDL code:  counter overflow.  The `buggy_counter.vhdl` file contains a counter that increments on each clock cycle. However, it lacks proper handling of the case when the counter reaches its maximum value (15). When the counter increments beyond 15, it will wrap around to 0 or exhibit undefined behavior, depending on the simulator and synthesis tool.  The solution, `fixed_counter.vhdl`, shows how to correctly implement the counter with overflow handling.
